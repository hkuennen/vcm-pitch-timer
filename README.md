# VCM Pitch Timer

## Philosophy

Our student initiative – the Venture Club Münster e.V. (VCM) – needed a timer to manage the time allocated for candidates to present their pitch decks.
The timer needed to display the remaining time to presenters, the jury, and the audience to ensure a smoother pitch experience and provide equal conditions for all participants.

To enhance the experience, the timer should play a ticking sound during the final 10 seconds, followed by a gong sound at the end of the countdown. Initially, we considered creating this pitch timer using PowerPoint and screen recordings. However, a dedicated timer app would be a much better solution. This approach would allow for additional functionality, such as pausing and restarting the timer, as well as setting custom countdown durations.

## Description

The VCM Pitch Timer is an application designed to help startup enthusiasts and aspiring founders manage and time their pitch presentations. It offers a simple, intuitive interface to set up timers for different sections of a pitch, ensuring that users stay organized and within their allotted time. This tool was particularly valuable for students and professionals presenting at the end-of-semester event of the Venture Club Münster.

To enhance the pitching experience, the app includes a ticking sound during the final 10 seconds of the timer and a gong sound when time runs out, providing clear cues to presenters to conclude their pitches effectively.
